IBM Storage Ready Nodes are a simple way to deploy IBM storage and data resiliency software on industry standard servers that enable an optimized and supported configuration in flexible and cloud scale configurations. IBM Storage Ready Nodes are designed to close the gap between software-only cloud scale storage systems and legacy storage offerings. By using IBM Storage Ready Nodes customers can accelerate storage infrastructure modernization, reduce project risk, and improve storage efficiency by providing industry standard servers and industry leading storage software with optimized and certified configurations supported from a single vendor for multiple customer requirements. This innovative approach to storage software makes it easier to build, deploy and expand software defined storage solutions in the data center.

IBM Storage Ready Nodes offer a preconfigured, validated, and scalable infrastructure for organizations looking to create a software-defined solution on an optimized platform and also simplify the management, support and deployment of the overall solution in the data center.  IBM provides a simplified deployment process, optimized performance options, on-line scalability from a base configuration to 1000s of nodes depending on the software option chosen. 

**Product overview** 

IBM Storage Ready Nodes are a simple, flexible and cost effective way to deploy IBM storage software on validated and optimized industry standard hardeware with both software and hardware support from a single vendor.  IBM Storage Ready Nodes are designed to be simple   all the way from initial purchase and deployment to the   ongoing management and scalability  of the system.  Firt choose the IBM Storage software you want to deploy .  Currently there  are three software options, IBM Cloud Object Storage,  IBM Storage Ceph and IBM Storaeg Defender.

Once the software option is chosen the next step is to choose the Ready Node devices required and the quantity or number of nodes.  Each software option supports different  amounts and different types of IBM Storage Ready Nodes.  Each software section will  provide information to help you choose the optimal configuration for your  requirements.  

After you select your configuration then work with your IBM Business partner or IBM Representative to purchase and deploy your IBM Storage Ready Nodes and the corresponding IBM Storage software.   Once the storage solution is purchased, download the installation instructions with the software license that is provided to install the Ready Nodes with the software component.   IBM Storage Ready Nodes will be shipped directly to you from IBM and you may install them into your environment yourself or optionally have them installed with the help of IBM or your Business Partner.  

**What you get with IBM Storage Ready Nodes** 

IBM Storage Ready Nodes accelerate storage infrastructure modernization, reduce project risk, and improve storage efficiency by providing IT flexibility and simplified management and support from a single vendor for multiple customer requirements.

Storage Ceph NVMe Flash Node Node 

**Configuring IBM Storage Ready Nodes with IBM Storage Ceph** 

To create an IBM Storage Ceph cluster its easy to start with IBM Storage Ready Nodes 

and scale one node at a time or a set of nodes depending on the availability and capacity efficiency required. The initial configuration can be as small as 4 nodes with 3 data copies or Erasure Code 2+2 or 7+ nodes for a more efficient capacity requirements. For 

example the smallest configuration and least number of nodes would consist of 4 nodes 

with 3X redundancy or EC 2+2 and this yields no downtime or data loss if a node become unavailable and also yields the fastest performance for a configuration. For max capacity 

with highest efficiency with no downtime or data loss if 2 nodes are unavailable the minimal configurationwould include 7 nodes. This 7 node configuration using 4TB disks will yield  512TB of usuable storage and is an excellent choice for deployment of IBM watsonx.data  which includes 768TB raw capacity of capacity. No matter what size theinitial deployment capacity or number of storage nodes, one can add more capacity at any time by adding nodes  and increasing capacity. 

When capacity is expanded the system usually also experiences a performance  increase and all expansions can de done without any production downtime to users accessing the  IBM Storager Ceph cluster. Once the cluster  is set up and configured and object buckets  are created the system is mainly self managed and very easy to maintain. For more  information on configurations[ read the documentation ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-ceph/6?topic=installing-storage-ceph)or read[ read the blog -> ](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/storage/blogs/david-wohlford1/2023/05/09/why-software-deployed-object-storage-becomes-the-c)

**Where to use IBM Storage Ready Nodes with IBM Storage Ceph** 

**Storage Infrastructure with IBM watsonx.data  ![](Aspose.Words.e3c930ef-a483-48e2-bfa0-887e77371a9d.012.jpeg)**

Watsonx.data makes it possible for enterprises to scale AI workloads using all their data 

with a fit-for-purpose data lakehouse architecture optimized for governed data and AI workloads, supported by querying, governance, and open data formats to access and 

share data. This is based on open-source technologies, including Presto and Iceberg. 

IBM Storage Ceph provides the storage infrastructure for a watsonx.data on-premises deployment. IBM watsonx.data includes 768TB of IBM Storage Ceph software license 

and support. The easiest way to start with IBM Storage Ready Nodes is with 4 nodes                       or 7 nodes depending if you desire perfromance or storage efficiency. The 4 node 

configuration provides the least number of nodes and the fastest performance with the 

ability to lose a node without incident. The 7 node configuration provides more nodes 

nodes and yields greater storage efficiency with the ability to loose 2 nodes without 

incident and the configuration can scale one or more nodes at a time as capacity needs grow. With watsonx.data and IBM Storage Ceph, you can access all your data across both 

databases and data lakes as each configuration can be optimized in the same Storage 

Ceph cluster. Share large volumes of data through open table formats, such as Apache 

Iceberg, built for high performance analytics and large-scale data processing and at the 

same time store large amount of data for other large data set analysis. IBM Storage Ceph 

also supports multiple vendor open formats for analytic data sets while allowing different  engines to access and share the same data, at the same time using tools like Parquet, 

Avro, Apache Orc and more. 

**Object storage as-a-service and cloud native applications**

IBM Storage Ceph with IBM Storage Ready Nodes is ideal for implementing an object storage service, with proven scalability and performance for both small and large object storage. With the open standards approach to object storage and the S3 interface, new and existing applications are easy to integrate with support for the latest S3 APIs and capabilities. Applications can access their storage with the same application API, in public, private, or hybrid clouds.  

**Ready Node Options for Cloud Object Storage** 

IBM CloudÒ Object Storage is a market-leading object storage solution for primary and   secondary AI and big data workloads.  Our solution is grounded in Dispersed Storage™ 

and a flexible Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) an  is proven for AI and big  

data solutions as well as offloading traditional storage workloads to object storage.  Storage solutions can  start with only three Slicestors and grow online to thousands of  Slicestors or exabytes of data.  Our software supports mixed configurations with IBM  Storage Ready Nodes and non Ready Node hardware and can scale or expand with no forklift  upgrades or downtime enabling investment protectionand long-term cost savings.  Applications can access storage from any location and optimize perfromance using geo- dispersed protection and efficiency  and  concurrent  and secure cloud native accessibility.

**Configuring IBM Storage Ready Nodes with IBM Cloud  Object Storage** 

To create an IBM Cloud Object Storage cluster that can scale to petabytes or even exabytes of  data online start with a Manager and then add 3 or more Slicestors and optionally 2 or more  Accessers for added performance.  There are two different Slicestors depending on capacity  requirements and IBM provides added flexibilty with unique drive sizes that enable  customers to create the most cost efficeint solution based on current capacity and expected  capacity growth requirements.   Once the system is set up and configured and object bukets  are created the system is almost self managed and very easy to maintain.
